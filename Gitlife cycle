Git File Lifecycle 

Untracked

File is new and Git isnâ€™t tracking it.

Tracked â†’ Modified

Git is tracking the file, and it has local changes.

Staged (git add)

Changes are marked to be committed.

Committed (git commit)

Changes are saved in your local Git database (.git folder).

Pushed (git push)

Commits from local repo are uploaded to the remote repo (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
