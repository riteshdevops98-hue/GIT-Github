# GIT-Github

History & Evolution
1. CVS (Concurrent Versions System)

Released: 1986

One of the first widely used VCS tools.

Allowed multiple developers to work on code at the same time.

Problems: weak branching/merging, performance issues.

Still important as the ancestor of modern VCS.

2. SVN (Apache Subversion)

Released: 2000 by CollabNet.

Created as a replacement for CVS.

Fixed many CVS problems (better branching, atomic commits, better handling of binary files).

Centralized: required a central server to store code.

Used in enterprises before Git became popular.

3. VCS (Version Control Systems)

Generic category of tools that track changes in code.

Includes: CVS, SVN, Git, Mercurial, etc.

Two types:

Centralized VCS: CVS, SVN (single server, prone to downtime).

Distributed VCS: Git, Mercurial (every developer has full repo copy).

4. SCM (Source Code Management)

Broader concept than VCS.

Encompasses process + tools for managing source code, collaboration, and workflows.

Built on top of VCS.

Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket extend Git (VCS) into full SCM systems with features like:

Pull requests

Branch protections

Code reviews

CI/CD pipelines

âœ… Real-World Analogy

CVS = Old filing cabinet (basic tracking, but messy).

SVN = Central office filing system (better organized, but needs central server).

Git (VCS) = Every employee has a full copy of the filing cabinet.

SCM (GitHub/GitLab) = Filing system + collaboration rules + approvals + automation.
